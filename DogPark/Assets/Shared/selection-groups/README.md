# SelectionGroups

SelectionGroups allow sets of objects to be grouped together, independent of the structure in the Hierarchy Window.

Open the SelectionGroup window via Window->General->Selection Groups.

Press the 'Add Group' button to add a group, then drag gameobjects from the Hierarchy Window to the group.

You can remove members from the group by right clicking on them and choosing remove.

You can right click on the group to open a context menu. This menu provides controls for removing, duplicating and configuring the group.

# Group Configuration
When selecting the Configure Group option from the context menu, a configuration window will open. You can change the group name, the group color and the selection query using this window.
