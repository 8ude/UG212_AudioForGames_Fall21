# UG212_AudioForGames_Fall21
ðŸ”Š Fall 2021 Repository for Audio for Digital Games at NYU ðŸ”Š

## GENERAL INFO:

All assignments are due before class, in the relevant folder on this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RY8HgZOwpG8qho7a7OvMWrj_0k4Ef3up?usp=sharing)

Name them **YourName_AssignmentTitle**

If it's a build, try to make both Win and Mac builds.  Compress the whole build (the exe, data folder, and any additional files that Unity makes).  If you're having issues making builds, get a few minutes of gameplay capture and upload that.


FINAL PROJECT - AUDIO GAME
------
Final presentations will be on **Monday Dec 13**

Your final project for this class is going to be to make an **audio game**

What's an audio game?  It could be:
 - a game with no visual feedback (audio-only game)
 - a game that uses audio as the primary gameplay mechanic (often this means audio-related puzzles, or something like microphone input)  
 - a game based around an interesting audio phenomenon, like ASMR or psycho-acoustics
 - a game based around music (like a rhythm game or a sound toy)

If you need some more inspiration, check out this recent podcast on [audio-only games and unsighted players](https://www.20k.org/episodes/videolessgames), this [Audio Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/agjam) that Maize Wallin organized last year, and [here is a website dedicted to audio-only games](https://audiogames.net/list-games/)

A few favorites of mine:

[Deep Sea by Robin Arnott](https://vimeo.com/17299509) (a No Quarter comission!)

[Papa Sangre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxXwotksBdM)

[Nightjar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeBFCQ-aBds) - also by the developers of Papa Sangre.  Unfortunately, a lot of the good audio only games were only on iOS.  The let's plays are all that's left.

[Blind Drive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1300600/Blind_Drive/)

You can work in groups, and you use can whatever game engine you'd like.

On **Wednesday Dec 1** I will be doing a progress check. At that point you'll have a little over a week to complete the assignment 

You will present your games at the last class on **Monday Dec 13** 

(You can continue to make any changes, and turn in late work, until Monday Dec 20)

Put your final build together with a text or pdf file that contains:
- your game name
- your team members names
- instructions on how to play

And upload a compressed file [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12qnfwD8rnjT5xjs-4NHz8Sp4oHSpaeyH?usp=sharing)



Week 11 Supplemental Assignment
------
Due Monday, Nov 22 at 5 pm

Prepare at least 3 questions for our guest on Voice Acting, [Sarah Elmaleh](https://www.sarahelmaleh.com/)


WEEK 11 ASSIGNMENT - MUSIC LOOPS
------
Due Monday, ~~November 22~~ November 29 at 4 pm

Create 2 musical loops, each around 20-30 seconds, to accompany the box art of your choosing from [This Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y1WT6uGnjSqSKiAI32qUJAip0p92kIA4?usp=sharing).  Think about contrasting gameplay segments (grass zone vs underwater zone, or stealth vs combat, or gameplay vs menu screen). 

Make a folder for your loops [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FRlZW6X8kNirELsbIAokDYyoMWQvTjb3?usp=sharing), and title your audio files with the game and the gameplay section.


WEEK 10 ASSIGNMENT - 3D SOUNDSPACE
------
Due Monday, November 15 at 4 pm Eastern

Using FMOD, Steam Audio and Unity, create a sonic environment/walking simulator/sound installation that makes use of the following:

- At least 5 audio sources that you use to tell some kind of story
- (optionally) Steam audio features like occlusion, reflection, and HRTF

I recommend starting from the SteamAudioPlayground scene in the example project 

If Steam audio (or FMOD) don't work on your machine for some reason, you can omit one of them and just use Steam Audio or FMOD.

[Here are some instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ifTZvkEMYmig998efhLC7vzPtUFwqb4a6ijjqu1BibM/edit?usp=sharing) on how to set up both FMOD studio and Steam Audio, if you need to do it from scratch.

[Upload your builds here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q9R5bPxBbgCm0saPobhtHCV4v1YgP1nT?usp=sharing)

PROJECT 2 - 3D RESKIN (DOG PARK)
------
Due Monday, November 8 at 4 pm Eastern

Clone/pull the repo because it now has a 3D playground for you to explore with your pet companion - the Dog Park!

Just like the 2D game reskin, you need to make the audio for this game from the ground up. You shouldn't need to do any scripting in Unity for this assignment, and nearly all of your changes will be in the FMOD Project. 

However, you are welcome to make code modifications that affect sound if you wish. Be advised that this project is quite a bit more complex than BlockDog, but fortunately the creator is your TA!

You can use whatever assets you which (synthesized, recorded, or taken from a sample library) but I would keep a few things in mind:

* You can now do a lot of layering and envelope manipulation directly in FMOD, so you might not need to work as much in Reaper. However, the best sound design makes use of layering and FX to acheieve the aesthetic goals of the project, and sometimes it's more practical to "bake" this into the sound assets.
* Ambience is hard to get right! We'll go over a few tools, but take some time to position emitters, find sound effects, and experiment with things like the scatterer instrument in order to make a compelling spatial environment
* Feel free to lean into a more abstract sound design, but think about characters! What can you do to make a unique player character and pet sounds?

As with Project 1, aim for 

* clarity of actions (can I tell what's going on based on sound?) 
* consistency (do the sounds work well with other sounds, and match the visuals and animations?)
and, most importantly, 
* a sense of style/aesthetics (are the sounds augmenting the game in a way that gives it life and character?).

When finished, create your builds and upload them [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mO4kScKYbpVabxpj6OsGqr-OAVpokZSv?usp=sharing)

PROJECT 1 - 2D reskin part 2
------
Due Monday, October 25 at 4 pm Eastern

Your creative director applauds your efforts, but wants to go in a different direction for the audio design.  

You've been assigned a unique audio limitation for this assignment. If you had a set of samples to use, those can be found [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tiJoj8GhVeFI1GSK8pOKK2GHkaA8o-Qo?usp=sharing)

Unless otherwise specified, you can do whatever you want with your samples or recordings, but you cannot use audio from anywhere else!

When you're done, please [UPLOAD YOUR BUILDS HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14GvHVE557Av_xxvTjC31tpF0Ez-3IMEZ?usp=sharing)



PROJECT 1 - 2D reskin part 1
------
Due Monday, October 18 at 4 pm Eastern

Upload both Windows and Mac builds [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JvcbjR1LKh-UuToQrr3Z2ZBjLPjQisp2?usp=sharing)

Gabe Cuzzillo's game "Block Dog" is silent.  Clone this repo, open BlockDog in Unity Hub (Unity version 2020.3.20f1), and give it sound!

If you need a Unity refresher, are new to the program, or just need a written refence on what to do, you can find a write up [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Iy4nT3MbeoLoDfEP5K5wEiEsUHY7wQRriO0M3FbfPro/edit?usp=sharing)

You should be working in the Scene called "Block Dog", on the Prefab called "AudioDirector."  Your work begins at the header **Start Editing Stuff Here**. The minimum is to create **12** assets for the game.  2 of these are loops - the Danger Loop and the Background Music (which could also be background ambience, if you prefer)

You can use:
* Whatever you find on the internet, or in the Audio for Digital Games Library.
* Anything using synthesis, if you wish.
* Any effects, including vst plugins that you find on the internet.  For example, [this](https://glitchmachines.com/products/fracture/) is a free one that was used a lot on the game Prey, and can mangle sounds into something completely different!
* Anything you record.

You are free to make any code modifications, as long as they only affect the audio

Things to avoid:
* Any Un-modified samples. You need to modify the sounds from freesound or the library in some way (changing pitch, layering, stretching, adding effects, etc).
* Repeating sounds for different actions (for example, using the same sound for "jump" as for "throw").  Try to re-use *portions* of a sound in other sounds.  
* Sounds that start "late" - your sounds should have little to no silence (0.01 seconds max) at the beginning.
* Sounds that end "early" - your sounds should always fade to silence.  
* Clicks/Pops in your loops

Aim for 
* clarity of actions (can I tell what's going on based on sound?) 
* consistency (does the sound seem to match with the visuals and animations?)
and, most importantly, 
* a sense of style/aesthetics (are the sounds augmenting the game in a way that gives it life and character?).


WEEK 5 ASSIGNMENT - FULL SCENE REDESIGN
-----

DUE TUESDAY October 12 at 4 pm

This week you'll be working with some longer and more complex clips of gameplay footage (20-30 seconds), and now you can use any technique at your disposal to re-create the sound. 

**[Here is the folder to pick clips from](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P8NaP6qP-H9xRLBZJLeS5e1FJl7EElTA?usp=sharing)**

Some tips:

 - The scenes may feel a bit overwhelming, so do some planning to break the scene down into actions (moments on the timeline) and layers (ambience, player actions, non-player actions, UI, etc).
 - You may run into issues with mixing, as there is a lot happening on the screen and it can't all be at the same volume.  Make use of compression, side chaining, EQ, and panning to give enough "space" for the most important parts of the action.
 - You're now responsible for everything in the scene! That does NOT mean that every little particle needs to have a sound, but it DOES mean that you should be intentional about what is making noise and what is not. Great sound design is all about the details. 

As before, render out a video and **[Upload your scene redesigns here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GhUDBwb0WsKHzuBfxq_3UX2dxmIpcV9x?usp=sharing)**

WEEK 4 ASSIGNMENT - RECORDING
------

DUE Monday, October 4 at 4 pm

Take a new clip of an action/spell/gameplay effect from [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W4l-TIUUXSLRCQbpDpSHbq8IW9mHJmbf?usp=sharing).  Try one that you didnâ€™t use last week.

This time, every layer of your sound needs to be recorded from scratch!

You can use any effects you want.  I highly recommend experimenting with pitch shifting, effects plugins, and automation envelopes.

Things to keep in mind:

 - it's going to be difficult to record in a "dry" environment, but do your best to minimize outside noise.

 - record 5 seconds of "silence" before you start your sound effect - you can use this to remove background noise.
 - get creative!  you're not going to be able to make a realistic explosion sound, but get some inspiration from [Marshall McGee on how you can use objects around you, and the microphone on an iPhone mic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_TGR2ux0nE)

As last week, render it out as a video. Upload it [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/127FvQkqpkBE18GyhftSEYLrQE7daCo8V?usp=sharing)



WEEK 3 ASSIGNMENT
------

DUE Monday, September 27 at 4 pm

Take one of the spell sounds or supermoves from [THIS FOLDER](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W4l-TIUUXSLRCQbpDpSHbq8IW9mHJmbf?usp=sharing) 

and create the audio from scratch.  At least one layer of the sound should be synthesized - you can use whatever synthesizer you wish (See the [Wiki](https://github.com/8ude/UG212_AudioForGames_Fall21/wiki/%F0%9F%94%8A-Audio-Plugin-and-SFX-Resources) for some free resources).

You will need to make sure you have the ability to view video in Reaper - for that, you need to [DOWNLOAD VLC](https://www.videolan.org/).  If you're having trouble, try following along with the first 5 minutes of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVbMbqGSB7E&t=1s) or checking in with Darwin or Corey during office hours.

Some things to strive for:

 - Try to match the **_motion_** of the effect through the sound. If it's very chaotic, then you might have a lot of noisey layers.  If it's more precise, then maybe have some focused tones tones. If there's a charge up, you probably want an ascending sound. 
 - Try to match the **_style_** of game. If it's coming from a sci fi world, you might use more single tones (sine, square or saw waves).  If it's a fantasy fireball, you will probably want more filtered noise, shaped with an envelope.

Don't worry about anything that isn't part of the spell effect or super move.  Things like voice, footsteps, enemy or creature noises, and music are not relevant to this assignment.

Some other suggestions:

 - Use layers!  Start by making more layers than you need, using both samples and synthesizers, then slowly take things out. [There's a great video about layering by sound designer Marshall McGee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biAgn2ct0A)
 - Try a spell from a game you're unfamiliar with. Some of these you might have heard 100 times or more if you played the game. Try to approach this as if you were the sound designer, and were just given the animation.

When finished, render a video and [UPLOAD IT HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vwGZ20IKPoaCG1ZzMMLVG5FHULPZqppq?usp=sharing).  Format doesn't really matter, but please be sure it has audio at 44.1 or 48kHz. You can render from Reaper if you get VLC (you might need the latest FFMPEG). Otherwise, something like Adobe Rush works well.


WEEK 2 ASSIGNMENTS
------


DUE Monday, September 20 at 4 pm.  This assignment is also avalable [AT THIS LINK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-brqxZFMzU7TiCHPviXjwtxdSyuLEn5Pa6WXwRQ5lkc/edit?usp=sharing), where you can respond in writing if you wish.

**Creating:** Make a 1-3 minute "Sound Story" In Reaper, and upload it [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fTybOzIliOeVBejwyo1RUmAQvfOdzSdI?usp=sharing).  
It might help to start with a setting that you want to convey, or some kind of scenario, or you can just grab a bunch of different sounds and make an audio collage!  Try to Experiment with changes in Envelopes, Pitch, Panning, and Volume to tell your story.  

**Reading** [John Cage - Lecture on Nothing](https://seansturm.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/john-cage-lecture-on-nothing.pdf)

Read the first 3 pages

Consider or the following:
 - Read a bit of the piece out loud, taking care to wait when there is space on the page
 - Py attention to the sounds that you hear in pauses between the words.  What do you hear?
 - Is this more a piece of music?  Of poetry?  Of just sounds?
 
**Listening:** [The Art Ensemble of Chicago - Illistrum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxjf54tsWEc)

Consider or respond in writing:
  - How many different instruments can you count in this piece?  Where do they use more tonal sounds?  More noisey ones?
  - How do you think the instruments and sound effects relate to the story?  Is it complementing the story?  Setting the scene?  Following the emotional arc?  
  - Are there moments where you think the instruments feel completely in sync with the storyteller?  or completely detached?


## WEEK 1 READING: 

Read the following sections from Jack Schaedler's website: [Intro, Signals and Sounds](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/) and [Sines and Sampling](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/part2.html)

Some questions to consider:
 - Where else have you heard the term "aliasing"?  Can you think of any time that you experienced "aliasing" and what it meant?
 - What are some reasons we might "over-sample" audio?  Think about the ways we might be manipulating audio when we create sound effects.
 - What is the lowest frequency range that we can use to record speech and still distinguish words?  Why do you think this is?

Listening - [Tristan Perich: 1-Bit Symphony](https://tristanperich.bandcamp.com/album/1-bit-symphony) - at least Movement 1.  TURN YOUR SOUND DOWN.

Things to consider when listening:
 - The reading had to do with frequencies, which affect sample _rate_ .  This music is constrained by bit depth, which restricts each sample's _amplitude_.
 - What does "1-bit" mean?  Why do you think the composer adopted this constraint?  What are some ways this piece generates variety using only 1 bit?  
 - Do you hear more pitches, or more noises in this piece?  Are there any places that seem more pitchy or more noisey?
 - What kind of state of mind does this piece put you in? Does it remind you of any other games, film, or music you've heard? 



## WEEK 1 ASSIGNMENT: Game Audio Analysis

With a partner, play a game and analyze the audio.  [Here's a list of games to choose from](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZPX06JR-WmMS_hmlxbEcNhKv0AcsoYTNZstI3hJRXDs/edit?usp=sharing), but let me know if you have a different one in mind.  

At some point in the semester, you will be giving a 5 min presentation on the audio of this game.  Sign up in that same link.  In addition to critically listening to the game, try to find some information about how the audio was created and implemented.  

[Here's a detailed writeup to get you started, with some additional resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JzJhECHHvdumALEAY_tflZR7bVndUqQtPNK6sI-ztb0/edit?usp=sharing)
