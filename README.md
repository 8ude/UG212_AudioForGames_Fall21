ðŸ”Š Fall 2021 Repository for Audio for Digital Games at NYU ðŸ”Š

## GENERAL INFO:

All assignments are due before class, in the relevant folder on this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RY8HgZOwpG8qho7a7OvMWrj_0k4Ef3up?usp=sharing)

Name them **YourName_AssignmentTitle**

If it's a build, try to make both Win and Mac builds.  Compress the whole build (the exe, data folder, and any additional files that Unity makes).  If you're having issues making builds, get a few minutes of gameplay capture and upload that.


WEEK 2 ASSIGNMENTS
------


DUE Monday, September 20 at 4 pm.  This assignment is also avalable [AT THIS LINK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-brqxZFMzU7TiCHPviXjwtxdSyuLEn5Pa6WXwRQ5lkc/edit?usp=sharing), where you can respond in writing if you wish.

**Creating:** Make a 1-3 minute "Sound Story" In Reaper, and upload it [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fTybOzIliOeVBejwyo1RUmAQvfOdzSdI?usp=sharing).  
It might help to start with a setting that you want to convey, or some kind of scenario, or you can just grab a bunch of different sounds and make an audio collage!  Try to Experiment with changes in Envelopes, Pitch, Panning, and Volume to tell your story.  

**Reading** [John Cage - Lecture on Nothing](https://seansturm.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/john-cage-lecture-on-nothing.pdf)

Read the first 3 pages

Consider or the following:
 - Read a bit of the piece out loud, taking care to wait when there is space on the page
 - Py attention to the sounds that you hear in pauses between the words.  What do you hear?
 - Is this more a piece of music?  Of poetry?  Of just sounds?
 
**Listening:** [The Art Ensemble of Chicago - Illistrum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxjf54tsWEc)

Consider or respond in writing:
  - How many different instruments can you count in this piece?  Where do they use more tonal sounds?  More noisey ones?
  - How do you think the instruments and sound effects relate to the story?  Is it complementing the story?  Setting the scene?  Following the emotional arc?  
  - Are there moments where you think the instruments feel completely in sync with the storyteller?  or completely detached?


## WEEK 1 READING: 

Read the following sections from Jack Schaedler's website: [Intro, Signals and Sounds](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/) and [Sines and Sampling](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/part2.html)

Some questions to consider:
 - Where else have you heard the term "aliasing"?  Can you think of any time that you experienced "aliasing" and what it meant?
 - What are some reasons we might "over-sample" audio?  Think about the ways we might be manipulating audio when we create sound effects.
 - What is the lowest frequency range that we can use to record speech and still distinguish words?  Why do you think this is?

Listening - [Tristan Perich: 1-Bit Symphony](https://tristanperich.bandcamp.com/album/1-bit-symphony) - at least Movement 1.  TURN YOUR SOUND DOWN.

Things to consider when listening:
 - The reading had to do with frequencies, which affect sample _rate_ .  This music is constrained by bit depth, which restricts each sample's _amplitude_.
 - What does "1-bit" mean?  Why do you think the composer adopted this constraint?  What are some ways this piece generates variety using only 1 bit?  
 - Do you hear more pitches, or more noises in this piece?  Are there any places that seem more pitchy or more noisey?
 - What kind of state of mind does this piece put you in? Does it remind you of any other games, film, or music you've heard? 



## WEEK 1 ASSIGNMENT: Game Audio Analysis

With a partner, play a game and analyze the audio.  [Here's a list of games to choose from](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZPX06JR-WmMS_hmlxbEcNhKv0AcsoYTNZstI3hJRXDs/edit?usp=sharing), but let me know if you have a different one in mind.  

At some point in the semester, you will be giving a 5 min presentation on the audio of this game.  Sign up in that same link.  In addition to critically listening to the game, try to find some information about how the audio was created and implemented.  

[Here's a detailed writeup to get you started, with some additional resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JzJhECHHvdumALEAY_tflZR7bVndUqQtPNK6sI-ztb0/edit?usp=sharing)
