If it's a build, try to make both Win and Mac builds.  Compress the whole build (the exe, data folder, and any additional files that Unity makes).  If you're having issues making builds, get a few minutes of gameplay capture and upload that.


## WEEK 1 ASSIGNMENT: Game Audio Analysis

With a partner, play a game and analyze the audio.  [Here's a list of games to choose from](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZPX06JR-WmMS_hmlxbEcNhKv0AcsoYTNZstI3hJRXDs/edit?usp=sharing), but let me know if you have a different one in mind.  

At some point in the semester, you will be giving a 5 min presentation on the audio of this game.  Sign up in that same link.  In addition to critically listening to the game, try to find some information about how the audio was created and implemented.  

[Here's a detailed writeup to get you started, with some additional resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JzJhECHHvdumALEAY_tflZR7bVndUqQtPNK6sI-ztb0/edit?usp=sharing)
