# UG212_AudioForGames_Fall21
ðŸ”Š Fall 2021 Repository for Audio for Digital Games at NYU ðŸ”Š

## GENERAL INFO:

All assignments are due before class, in the relevant folder on this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RY8HgZOwpG8qho7a7OvMWrj_0k4Ef3up?usp=sharing)

Name them **YourName_AssignmentTitle**

If it's a build, try to make both Win and Mac builds.  Compress the whole build (the exe, data folder, and any additional files that Unity makes).  If you're having issues making builds, get a few minutes of gameplay capture and upload that.


## WEEK 1 READING: 

Read the following sections from Jack Schaedler's website: [Intro, Signals and Sounds](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/) and [Sines and Sampling](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/part2.html)

Some questions to consider:
 - Where else have you heard the term "aliasing"?  Can you think of any time that you experienced "aliasing" and what it meant?
 - What are some reasons we might "over-sample" audio?  Think about the ways we might be manipulating audio when we create sound effects.
 - What is the lowest frequency range that we can use to record speech and still distinguish words?  Why do you think this is?

Listening - [Tristan Perich: 1-Bit Symphony](https://tristanperich.bandcamp.com/album/1-bit-symphony) - at least Movement 1.  TURN YOUR SOUND DOWN.

Things to consider when listening:
 - The reading had to do with frequencies, which affect sample _rate_ .  This music is constrained by bit depth, which restricts each sample's _amplitude_.
 - What does "1-bit" mean?  Why do you think the composer adopted this constraint?  What are some ways this piece generates variety using only 1 bit?  
 - Do you hear more pitches, or more noises in this piece?  Are there any places that seem more pitchy or more noisey?
 - What kind of state of mind does this piece put you in? Does it remind you of any other games, film, or music you've heard? 



## WEEK 1 ASSIGNMENT: Game Audio Analysis

With a partner, play a game and analyze the audio.  [Here's a list of games to choose from](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZPX06JR-WmMS_hmlxbEcNhKv0AcsoYTNZstI3hJRXDs/edit?usp=sharing), but let me know if you have a different one in mind.  

At some point in the semester, you will be giving a 5 min presentation on the audio of this game.  Sign up in that same link.  In addition to critically listening to the game, try to find some information about how the audio was created and implemented.  

[Here's a detailed writeup to get you started, with some additional resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JzJhECHHvdumALEAY_tflZR7bVndUqQtPNK6sI-ztb0/edit?usp=sharing)
