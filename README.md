ðŸ”Š Fall 2021 Repository for Audio for Digital Games at NYU ðŸ”Š

## GENERAL INFO:

All assignments are due before class, in the relevant folder on this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RY8HgZOwpG8qho7a7OvMWrj_0k4Ef3up?usp=sharing)

Name them **YourName_AssignmentTitle**

If it's a build, try to make both Win and Mac builds.  Compress the whole build (the exe, data folder, and any additional files that Unity makes).  If you're having issues making builds, get a few minutes of gameplay capture and upload that.

WEEK 5 ASSIGNMENT - FULL SCENE REDESIGN
-----

DUE TUESDAY October 12 at 4 pm

This week you'll be working with some longer and more complex clips of gameplay footage (20-30 seconds), and now you can use any technique at your disposal to re-create the sound. 

**[Here is the folder to pick clips from](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P8NaP6qP-H9xRLBZJLeS5e1FJl7EElTA?usp=sharing)**

Some tips:

 - The scenes may feel a bit overwhelming, so do some planning to break the scene down into actions (moments on the timeline) and layers (ambience, player actions, non-player actions, UI, etc).
 - You may run into issues with mixing, as there is a lot happening on the screen and it can't all be at the same volume.  Make use of compression, side chaining, EQ, and panning to give enough "space" for the most important parts of the action.
 - You're now responsible for everything in the scene! That does NOT mean that every little particle needs to have a sound, but it DOES mean that you should be intentional about what is making noise and what is not. Great sound design is all about the details. 

As before, render out a video and **[Upload your scene redesigns here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GhUDBwb0WsKHzuBfxq_3UX2dxmIpcV9x?usp=sharing)

WEEK 4 ASSIGNMENT - RECORDING
------

DUE Monday, October 4 at 4 pm

Take a new clip of an action/spell/gameplay effect from [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W4l-TIUUXSLRCQbpDpSHbq8IW9mHJmbf?usp=sharing).  Try one that you didnâ€™t use last week.

This time, every layer of your sound needs to be recorded from scratch!

You can use any effects you want.  I highly recommend experimenting with pitch shifting, effects plugins, and automation envelopes.

Things to keep in mind:

 - it's going to be difficult to record in a "dry" environment, but do your best to minimize outside noise.

 - record 5 seconds of "silence" before you start your sound effect - you can use this to remove background noise.
 - get creative!  you're not going to be able to make a realistic explosion sound, but get some inspiration from [Marshall McGee on how you can use objects around you, and the microphone on an iPhone mic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_TGR2ux0nE)

As last week, render it out as a video. Upload it [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/127FvQkqpkBE18GyhftSEYLrQE7daCo8V?usp=sharing)



WEEK 3 ASSIGNMENT
------

DUE Monday, September 27 at 4 pm

Take one of the spell sounds or supermoves from [THIS FOLDER](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W4l-TIUUXSLRCQbpDpSHbq8IW9mHJmbf?usp=sharing) 

and create the audio from scratch.  At least one layer of the sound should be synthesized - you can use whatever synthesizer you wish (See the [Wiki](https://github.com/8ude/UG212_AudioForGames_Fall21/wiki/%F0%9F%94%8A-Audio-Plugin-and-SFX-Resources) for some free resources).

You will need to make sure you have the ability to view video in Reaper - for that, you need to [DOWNLOAD VLC](https://www.videolan.org/).  If you're having trouble, try following along with the first 5 minutes of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVbMbqGSB7E&t=1s) or checking in with Darwin or Corey during office hours.

Some things to strive for:

 - Try to match the **_motion_** of the effect through the sound. If it's very chaotic, then you might have a lot of noisey layers.  If it's more precise, then maybe have some focused tones tones. If there's a charge up, you probably want an ascending sound. 
 - Try to match the **_style_** of game. If it's coming from a sci fi world, you might use more single tones (sine, square or saw waves).  If it's a fantasy fireball, you will probably want more filtered noise, shaped with an envelope.

Don't worry about anything that isn't part of the spell effect or super move.  Things like voice, footsteps, enemy or creature noises, and music are not relevant to this assignment.

Some other suggestions:

 - Use layers!  Start by making more layers than you need, using both samples and synthesizers, then slowly take things out. [There's a great video about layering by sound designer Marshall McGee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biAgn2ct0A)
 - Try a spell from a game you're unfamiliar with. Some of these you might have heard 100 times or more if you played the game. Try to approach this as if you were the sound designer, and were just given the animation.

When finished, render a video and [UPLOAD IT HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vwGZ20IKPoaCG1ZzMMLVG5FHULPZqppq?usp=sharing).  Format doesn't really matter, but please be sure it has audio at 44.1 or 48kHz. You can render from Reaper if you get VLC (you might need the latest FFMPEG). Otherwise, something like Adobe Rush works well.


WEEK 2 ASSIGNMENTS
------


DUE Monday, September 20 at 4 pm.  This assignment is also avalable [AT THIS LINK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-brqxZFMzU7TiCHPviXjwtxdSyuLEn5Pa6WXwRQ5lkc/edit?usp=sharing), where you can respond in writing if you wish.

**Creating:** Make a 1-3 minute "Sound Story" In Reaper, and upload it [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fTybOzIliOeVBejwyo1RUmAQvfOdzSdI?usp=sharing).  
It might help to start with a setting that you want to convey, or some kind of scenario, or you can just grab a bunch of different sounds and make an audio collage!  Try to Experiment with changes in Envelopes, Pitch, Panning, and Volume to tell your story.  

**Reading** [John Cage - Lecture on Nothing](https://seansturm.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/john-cage-lecture-on-nothing.pdf)

Read the first 3 pages

Consider or the following:
 - Read a bit of the piece out loud, taking care to wait when there is space on the page
 - Py attention to the sounds that you hear in pauses between the words.  What do you hear?
 - Is this more a piece of music?  Of poetry?  Of just sounds?
 
**Listening:** [The Art Ensemble of Chicago - Illistrum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxjf54tsWEc)

Consider or respond in writing:
  - How many different instruments can you count in this piece?  Where do they use more tonal sounds?  More noisey ones?
  - How do you think the instruments and sound effects relate to the story?  Is it complementing the story?  Setting the scene?  Following the emotional arc?  
  - Are there moments where you think the instruments feel completely in sync with the storyteller?  or completely detached?


## WEEK 1 READING: 

Read the following sections from Jack Schaedler's website: [Intro, Signals and Sounds](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/) and [Sines and Sampling](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/part2.html)

Some questions to consider:
 - Where else have you heard the term "aliasing"?  Can you think of any time that you experienced "aliasing" and what it meant?
 - What are some reasons we might "over-sample" audio?  Think about the ways we might be manipulating audio when we create sound effects.
 - What is the lowest frequency range that we can use to record speech and still distinguish words?  Why do you think this is?

Listening - [Tristan Perich: 1-Bit Symphony](https://tristanperich.bandcamp.com/album/1-bit-symphony) - at least Movement 1.  TURN YOUR SOUND DOWN.

Things to consider when listening:
 - The reading had to do with frequencies, which affect sample _rate_ .  This music is constrained by bit depth, which restricts each sample's _amplitude_.
 - What does "1-bit" mean?  Why do you think the composer adopted this constraint?  What are some ways this piece generates variety using only 1 bit?  
 - Do you hear more pitches, or more noises in this piece?  Are there any places that seem more pitchy or more noisey?
 - What kind of state of mind does this piece put you in? Does it remind you of any other games, film, or music you've heard? 



## WEEK 1 ASSIGNMENT: Game Audio Analysis

With a partner, play a game and analyze the audio.  [Here's a list of games to choose from](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZPX06JR-WmMS_hmlxbEcNhKv0AcsoYTNZstI3hJRXDs/edit?usp=sharing), but let me know if you have a different one in mind.  

At some point in the semester, you will be giving a 5 min presentation on the audio of this game.  Sign up in that same link.  In addition to critically listening to the game, try to find some information about how the audio was created and implemented.  

[Here's a detailed writeup to get you started, with some additional resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JzJhECHHvdumALEAY_tflZR7bVndUqQtPNK6sI-ztb0/edit?usp=sharing)
